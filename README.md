# Simple-Interest-Calculator
This calculator will calculate "Simple Interest" from "Primary Loan Amount" (user provided), "Interests Rate" (user provided), and "Loan Time Period" (user provided).

The working Formula is:

Simple Interest = ( Primary Loan Amount * Interests Rate * Loan Time Period ) / 100

( **S.I = ( P.A * I.R * T.P ) / 100** ) 

and this calculator works in a WHILE loop so that it won't end after 1st run instead ask the user if he/she wants to calculate another or exit.

PS: This is first formal app that I made for practice in my first week of learning Python programming :D
